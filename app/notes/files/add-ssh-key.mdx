Log into a remote machine without typing in a password.

1. Generate New SSH Key (if needed)
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "email@example.com"
```

2. Start SSH Agent & Add Key
```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```
<br />
3. Copy Public Key to Remote Machine
```bash
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub me@server-ip-address
```
<br />
4. Streamline with a Config File
   - Update (or Create): `~/.ssh/config`
```
Host remote-machine
    HostName server-ip-address
    User me
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```
<br />
5. Test Connection (from Host)
```bash
ssh remote-machine
```
